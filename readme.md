# Tim's Vegan Hactivists Challenge

This is my solution to the Vegan Hactivist challenge. It's not super polished, but it does the job.

## Instructions

+ Git pull the project 
+ Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
+ Update `.env` database credentials (and other things for production)
+ Run `composer install` (requires [composer](https://getcomposer.org/))
+ Run `npm run dev` (or `npm run prod` for production) (requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))
+ Run `php artisan key:generate`
+ Run `php artisan migrate --seed`
+ Run `php artisan serve`

Thanks!
